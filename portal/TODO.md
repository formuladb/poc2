### FormulaDB intro

#### Goals

Formula DB aims to be a platform for developing data driven applications easily using as much as possible pure functional programming.

#### Current implementation in a few words

FormulaDB currently is:
 - Type Safe, Big Data Formula Engine: almost pure-functional formula execution engine that compiles functional expressions into observables/observers and imperative triggers executed when observables are modified
 - App Builder: autocomplete for Formulas and Forms, live preview Formula results and Forms
 - ACID transaction manager added over an optimistic locking scalable key value store
