  - 2006: generated UIs based on simple JSON metadata for simple SET/GET operations, all custom logic hand-coded
    - Noticed that customers are asking very often for Excel Exports
  - 2009: Designed more strict API for implementing custom business logic: Ruby (Activerecord) for server side, Backbone.js on client site
    - Started wondering why business experts can build complex Spreadsheets but have difficuly understanding an reasoning with basic imperative programming constructs: variables, control flow
  - 2013: Tried to build a metadata language for implementing custom business logic using jquery-like DSL for defining RDBMS-like triggers between domain model entities (tables), targeted at non-programmers but still techincal people: QA, Support, Deployment
    - Problem: imperative programming is difficult to work with by non-programmers. Breaking down a task into imperative programming control flow statements, keeping track of mutating state, these are hard for non-programmers
  - 2015: FormulaDB concept started to take shape, use the same metadata approach as before: define Entities (or Tables) but the business logic should be defined in a pure functional domain specific language, no more imperative trigger definitions.
    - At this point it was clear why non-programmers can sucessfully use Spreadsheets: pure functional formulas, no state/variables to keep track of, no side-effects to keep track of mentally, a user could build a complex spreadsheet focusing on one formula at a time
    - However Spreadsheets have issues:
      - "Various studies report that nearly 9 out of 10 spreadsheets (88%) contain errors", because it is difficult to see what you have messed up 2-3 Sheets away when you change/add/delete a formula. (TODO: more research on this issue needed to better identify the root causes)
      - More importantly spreadsheets don't help users implement concurrency and business transactions
    - The challenge for FormulaDB was how to enable users to work with familiar formulas/functions but in the same time allow them to implement business transactions, some classic examples:
      - inventory management with real-time stock positive validations
      - money transfers between accounts with real-time balance positive validations
    - The name chosen back then was MetaWiz (Metadata Wizard) instead of FormulaDB 
  - 2016: Actively started working on FormulaDB (MetaWiz)
  - 2017: Kappa architecture Streaming plaform/framework PoC powered by Kafka Streams.
    - The aim was to allow developers to implement custom businees logic/transactions (mostly in the IoT industry) without worrying about scalability (failover, sharding), ACID, distributed transactions, etc. Ideally users would just implement the actual business logic without any boilerplate, the platform would make sure that logic would run in a event-sourced distributed scalable environment.
  - 2017: FormulaDB, MVP powered by CouchDB/PouchDB with Formula Engine and Transaction Manager added on top offering full ACID guarantees ??
  - 2018: abstracted storage, added in-memory and Postresql implementation, dropped CouchDB
  - 2018 Sep: joined Techcelerator, FORMULA DATABASE company created
