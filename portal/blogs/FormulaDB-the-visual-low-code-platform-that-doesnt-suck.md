Over the years there were many visual tools that most developers hate, TODO examples (BPEL, etc).

But the tools we love and make use productive developers are also visual tools with tons of buttons, menus, options (vim, vscode, Eclipse).

Why don't we hate these tools? Because IDEs just help up navigate and manage the existing layers in out technology stack, they don't try to create a new abstraction layer over the many layers we already have.

FormulaDB tries to offer the non-intrusive, lovable, helpful IDEs experience for developers while also providing a simpler "No Code" experience for non-developers. 

The "No Code" mode is less powerful, but its powerful enough so that most times business people can satisfy their own requirements using a high level language: Tables, Formulas (computed columns, validations, rules), Pages. From this perspective FormulaDB is a also a good communication tool making business people and developers speak a common language which is powerful enough to implement a virtually unlimited number of use cases.

Developers will be the maintainers of the formuladb language: provide support with Formulas/Pages, monitor the system for errors and/or performance issues, implement new functions, implement new components and themes to be used in Pages.
