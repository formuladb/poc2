# Sales Presentation TODO

 * Small Business use cases

    * 
 * Large business use cases
    * Generic GUI
    * Testing tool
    * User-defined GUI embedded 

 * Cloud platform use cases
    * There are a lot of cloud platforms lately, offering simple ways to build scalable and fault tolerant backend apps, IoT, big data, etc
    * They are super vendor-specific and not open source
    * They are still very complex, requiring trainings and real developers to operate, they are not at all targeted at business people
    * we could position as a simple "Reactive Cloud" platform, where each table can also be seen as an event stream and each formula is a reactive piece of functionality, similar to the "Cloud Functions" in Azure/Google/AWS
