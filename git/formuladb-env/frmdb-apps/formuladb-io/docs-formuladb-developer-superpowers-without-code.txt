In FormulaDB everything is a Table. Things you usually find in dedicated, often specific and complicate screens in other platform, in FormulaDB you will find them in a regular table. 

Users roles and permissions are stored in regular tables. Email/sms notifications can be manipulated as regular tables.

Working with tables is pretty intuitive for most people:
- Add/Delete/Modify rows
- Add/Delete/Modify simple columns

Even a bit more advanced knowledge is pretty easy to acquire:
- Add/Delete/Modify columns with simple formulas like basic arithmetic on number and dates 
- Add/Delete/Modify columns with formulas that compute aggregations, e.g. SUMIF, COUNTIF
