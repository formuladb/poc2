/**
 * Formula editor is the central part of the application:
 *   - it must be super user friendly, no programming skills required to create business logic
 *   - it must allow re-factoring use-cases: replace, move, copy/clone-then-modify
 *   - factorization is done by defining intermediary columns to hold intermediary results
 *   - factorization will also be possible by allowing "user-defined-formulas"
 *   - formulas and in fact all metadata and ui-metadata should be DEVELOPER FRIENDLY. see [dev_features]{@link ../dev_features/*js}
