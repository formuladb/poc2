//Javascript 
// - will allow independent mobile+desktop apps to be developed using the same technology as server sied
// - more difficult to code without a good API+runtime type system
//
//Java
// - different technology stack for server side and client side
// - can we reuse the engine on all platforms: server, desktop, mobile ? It's Java, it should be portable
//
//Ruby
// - already have some generic code written with Postgresql, dev is fast, reuse knowledge
// - not easily reusable for mobile+desktop
